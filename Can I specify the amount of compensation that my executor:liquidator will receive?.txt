Can I specify the amount of compensation that my executor/liquidator will receive?

Executors (called liquidators in Quebec) are entitled to claim compensation. There is a formula in each province that acts as a guideline for executor compensation, so it's not necessary to outline this specifically in your will. You can, however, add a clause specifying the compensation your executor will be entitled to, but you would need to do that with a lawyer.

Every province has different rules around how much an executor can claim from the estate - if you would like to specify how much your executor can claim, or outline any other specifics around executor compensation, you would need to visit a lawyer. 

Quebec only: If compensation is not outlined in the will, the compensation is determined by the heirs or, if they donâ€™t agree, by the court.
