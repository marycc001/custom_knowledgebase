How do I list the parents of my children?

If you're adding a child to your will, we'll ask you to add a few details about your child. It's going to ask for first name, last name, middle name if applicable, as well as a date of birth. From there, the last step is to add the parents of the child. So the parent of the child will typically be, one of them being yourself, or in this case, Jane Doe, and then the other parent would be a spouse or another person. If the child is not a child of your spouse as well, you can put in another person as a placeholder piece of information that will not affect the outcome of the final documents.
