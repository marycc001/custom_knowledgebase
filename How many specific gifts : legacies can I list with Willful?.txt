How many specific gifts / legacies can I list with Willful?

With Willful you can leave as many gifts (called legacies in Quebec) as you'd like but you cannot split those gifts between individuals or organizations. 

Currently Willful does not support adding/attaching a ledger with a list of specific gifts, but we do have an "additional memoranda" clause in our will, which instructs the executor / liquidator to follow any guidance on distribution of personal property even if it's not outlined in the will.
