Can I have more than one executor / estate trustee to manage things like stocks or equity and keep it separate from my personal estate?

Unfortunately with Willful, we do not allow for more than one executor or estate trustee for things like stock/equity investments. Wills created with Willful, however, include a carry on business clause that allows an Executor/Estate Trustee to step in temporarily and act on behalf of you, in the context of the business, to bring in appropriate help or make decisions to keep the business moving until further arrangements can be made.

If you would like to create a dual will that keeps businesses or assets separate from your personal estate then we advise you seek legal advice. Willful does not delve into the specifics of business assets, operations, succession or allow you to create a dual will.

Business owners should also look at their shareholders agreement to see what (if any) clauses address the death of a shareholder. If a person is a sole owner of a business then that business would be considered an asset of the person who has passed away, as long as there was not a separate or dual will created for the business or shares held.

You should speak with a lawyer or tax expert for more information, as Willful is not able to provide guidance to anyone on their specific situation.
