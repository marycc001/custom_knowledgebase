What does a "specific gift/legacy" mean? What is a bequest?

Bequests or specific gifts (legacies in Quebec) are identifiable pieces of property or monetary amounts gifted to individuals or charities/organizations upon your passing. They are not included in your residue (everything that's left after debts/taxes/expenses are paid, and specific gifts are distributed), and are paid out before the residue. Common gifts include cash, jewellery, art, clothing, or mementos with special meaning. 

On Willful, you can leave specific gifts/legacies easily on our gifts page.
