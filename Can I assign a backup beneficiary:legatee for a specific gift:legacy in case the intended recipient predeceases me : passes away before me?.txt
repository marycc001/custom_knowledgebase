Can I assign a backup beneficiary/legatee for a specific gift/legacy in case the intended recipient predeceases me / passes away before me?

Unfortunately we do not currently have the ability to name a backup for specific gifts (called legacies in Quebec) should the beneficiary (called a legatee in Quebec) predecease you. If the gift is unable to reach the intended recipient for any reason, the property/cash/belonging falls back under the residue of the estate. If your chosen beneficiary predeceases you, you can always come back and update your will at any time, no extra charge. Please note, you will need to follow the instructions to execute your updated will in order to put it into effect and revoke previous versions.
