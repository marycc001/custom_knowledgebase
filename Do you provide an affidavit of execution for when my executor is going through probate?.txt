Can I specify the amount of compensation that my executor/liquidator will receive?

Willful provides a link to an affidavit of execution in each province, which can then be brought to a notary. For more information about affidavits of execution, and to find a link to the guide in your province, read our guide:

An affidavit of execution is a document that helps to confirm the validity of the will. This form is filled out by one of your witnesses, and states that they were with you when you signed your will, and that they were in the presence of you (the will-maker) as well as the other witness, and they confirm these statements to be true. After completing the form, the witness needs to get the form notarized, and then it is stored with your will. This can also be completed at the time of your passing.

It is then provided to the courts after you pass away as part of an executorâ€™s application for a grant of probate.
