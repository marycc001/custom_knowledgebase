Can I leave property like a home or cottage to a specific individual as a specific gift/legacy?

Short answer: yes, but be aware of the type of ownership and how that affects how it passes on.

More details:

Bequests or specific gifts (legacies in Quebec) are identifiable pieces of property or monetary amounts gifted to individuals or charities/organizations upon your passing. They are not included in your residue (everything that's left after debts/taxes/expenses are paid, and specific gifts are distributed), and are paid out before the residue. Common gifts include cash, jewellery, art, clothing, or mementos with special meaning. 

When property is owned jointly with rights of survivorship, this means that upon death, the property passes automatically by right of survivorship to the surviving joint owner(s). If both owners passed away at the same time, the property would be split equally under each person's estate. 

If you own property jointly and want to leave your half to someone other than the joint owner, you need to convert to owning the property jointly with tenants in common. Under this type of ownership, you can gift your portion of the property, either as a specific gift/legacy, or you can distribute it according to your residue. The proportionate share of the property owned by the deceased person does not pass automatically to the surviving owner(s) of the property, but rather forms part of their estate. 

If you're like to change your type of ownership, you would need to speak with a real estate lawyer.

On Willful, you can leave specific gifts/legacies easily in the "Your Estate" section.
