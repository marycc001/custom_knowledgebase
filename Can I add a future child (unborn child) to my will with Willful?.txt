Can I add a future child (unborn child) to my will with Willful?

As of now, Willful cannot account for future children who are yet to be born, although beneficiaries can include offspring conceived before and born alive after your death, and descendants conceived and born alive after your death. You can create provisions for unborn children in your will by visiting a lawyer. If you wish to use Willful, you can continue with the child(ren) you currently have (if any) and come back to edit your documents when any new child is born. Just remember to execute the new version of your will so it's legally valid and revokes any previous versions.
