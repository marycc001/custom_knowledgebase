Does my power of attorney for property give permission to the assigned attorney to act on my behalf with my business?

On a surface level, the answer is yes, so long as there are no stated restrictions to the contrary.

The Attorney will be in a position to act as an owner of the shares (vote, appoint or conduct business as the owner would), but cannot be directly delegated the director duties, if applicable.

Either the remaining directors would continue acting, or the Attorney as shareholder would appoint themselves or someone else (with approval of any other voting shareholders, if applicable).
