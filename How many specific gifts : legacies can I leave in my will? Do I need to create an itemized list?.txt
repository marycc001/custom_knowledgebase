How many specific gifts / legacies can I leave in my will? Do I need to create an itemized list?

You can add as many specific gifts (legacies in Quebec) as you’d like. If you have a large amount - for example you have a record collection and don’t want to list out every record - you can simply write “my record collection” and group the items together. If you have a large number of items that are not part of a collection, you can either itemize them in Willful specific gifts section, or you can compile a separate list of those items. Willful has an “additional memoranda” clause that instructs your executor / liquidator to distribute any items as per your wishes, even if they’re not contained in the will.
