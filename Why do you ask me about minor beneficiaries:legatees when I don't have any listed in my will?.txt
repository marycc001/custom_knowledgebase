Why do you ask me about minor beneficiaries/legatees when I don't have any listed in my will?

While you may not have any minor beneficiaries (called legatees in Quebec) at the time you create the will, you may by the time you pass away. This clause accounts for the fact that when you pass away, you may have minor beneficiaries (for example children, grandchildren, or nieces/nephews) who are minors, and it gives you the ability to decide at what age they will receive their inheritance.\'a0If there are no minors involved in your will, selecting an age here will not impact the legal content of your documents.}
