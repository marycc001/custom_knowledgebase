Can I assign joint attorneys in my power of attorney documents?

We do allow a user to choose multiple backup attorneys for their primary chosen attorney, but upon the recommendation of our legal advisors, we currently do not to allow for two attorneys / co-attorneys. 

From their experience, this can lead to complications down the road and can be avoided by allowing only one person to decide on matters.  

We understand that the responsibility of an attorney can be overwhelming and a co-attorney could help lighten the workload. We are working with our legal advisors to assess this feature for the future.
