Can I leave a gift, legacy or bequest for two / 2 people to share?

Willful does not allow a gift to be named to more than one individual or organization at a time. We hope to add more flexibility to this section in the future.

Please note that you also cannot use the "%" symbol in the text field when assigning a specific gift.
